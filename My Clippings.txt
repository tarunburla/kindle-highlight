He was adopted by Emperor Antoninus Pius at the age of seventeen, an act that effectively put young Marcus on the path to the throne. After the death of Antoninus Pius in 161 CE, Marcus became co-emperor with Lucius

I’ve learned to train my brain to take this as a positive moment. When I reach a wall, I know I’m close to the next stage of my development. Instead of giving up, I’m happy. All I need to do, is to take a break, rejuvenate, and let my mind recover. I hang out with my friends. Play some table tennis with my brother at our office. Listen to my favorite artist like Jay-Z, Bob Dylan, Kendrick Lamar, or Bon Iver. Watch movies (a lot of them). I just take some time to relax and let my brain get stronger while I’m not thinking or working on anything. And then, I get back to where I left off. I use my energy to break through the wall.

My drawing skills haven’t improved, but my articles have. And one of the reasons is that I take time to think about how I can visually share my idea. I want readers to immediately “get” what I’m trying to share in the article by looking at my drawings. That’s why I think a lot about visualizing an idea. Sometimes I draw a graph, sometimes I emphasize a sentence or word, and I even make simple cartoons. After I make the drawing, I often edit my article to make my idea clearer. And some articles even start with a drawing. This book also started with a drawing. It’s the drawing I used in the From Chaos To Clarity chapter. Here it is again: I made that drawing without a purpose. I was just visualizing some of my ideas. One of my ideas is that it used to be chaos in my mind, until I found a way to overcome it. As a result, I think clearly. That’s the whole drawing. And now it’s a book.

This doesn’t make sense at first sight, but when you think too hard, you often come up with bad ideas. That’s because you can’t actively think your way out of everything. We’ve all had good ideas while taking a shower. That’s because we’re not actively thinking.

It’s good to let your attention wander and stop thinking. This is also a part of controlling your mind. You have the ability to decide when you want to let go of your thoughts. Similar to relaxing your muscles when you lay on the couch after a tough day, you can let loose of your thoughts.

Thinking about details is nothing more than doing your job. If you’re a writer, your job is to write the best book you possibly can. If you’re a designer, your job is to create the best design you can. You’re not here to write one book and call it quits. Or to design one product and retire. If you want to grow—financially, spiritually, mentally—you must revisit the details all the time.

When you combine a few rules, you have a system. And a system helps you to take the thinking part out of the equation. The only thinking you need to do is when your system doesn’t give you the results you want. If my system would make me feel bad or gain weight, I would rethink it. And even if it works, a system is never perfect. That’s why I regularly think about what I can change or how I can improve my systems.

Practically speaking, there’s no purpose to doing something that outlasts you. You won’t be there to see it anyway. But that’s not the point. If we live our lives every day with that idea in mind—that we should strive for doing/creating useful things that matter to others—we end up spending our time on things that actually make a difference. When you do that, life automatically has meaning—to everyone.

Stop overwhelming yourself by continually changing the channels of your mind. Sharpen your intellect by making it a habit to do one thing at a time. Rediscover the value of consecutive tasking, instead of settling for the diluted quality that comes from simultaneous tasking. Exceptional work is always associated with periods of deep concentration. Nothing excellent ever comes from a scattered effort.

—Senses: There are only five ways to get anything into your brain, and those are through your senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. Your senses help you mentally recreate your world. If you learn to engage your senses, you will use more of your brain and improve your memory. Think of a horse. See it in your mind. Touch it, smell it, and hear it. You didn’t see the letters H-O-R-S-E in your mind; you saw a multisensory picture of what the word represents. Your senses make mind movies real and memorable. Use them! E—Exaggeration: Throughout this book, we will use images to represent concepts that we’d like to remember. But not just any images—exaggerated, sometimes silly, and sometimes nonsensical mind pictures. Which is easier to remember: a strawberry that is normal size, or one the size of a house? An elephant, or an elephant wearing a pink bikini? Make your mental images larger or smaller than life. The more you exaggerate the image you’re using to help you remember a concept, the easier it will be to recall later on. Exaggerate with humor; tickle your mind. There is no scientific evidence that learning must be serious. Make your images illogical. Have fun; create some exaggerated images to improve your memory. E—Energize: Give your mental pictures action. Would you rather watch a movie of your holiday or a slide show? What creates more feeling in your imagination: a horse standing still or a horse that is running and moving? Make your mental images as vivid and colorful as you can, not boring, flat, or black and white. Use action; it brings life to even the dullest information. Make your images act in illogical ways: You can weave, crash, stick, or wrap things together to help you remember them. Make things talk, sing, and dance. Think about the creations of the great genius Walt Disney: His characters and settings simply vibrate with life and fun—it’s why they became so beloved, and more importantly, so memorable. The process of imagination is a fun and creative process. The more enjoyment you can put into it, the better. When you read or hear something you want to remember, you can’t just will yourself to remember it. You have to focus on all the SEE principles and use your imagination to guarantee you’ll remember that information. Even if you don’t use a specific method from this book, the SEE principles will improve your concentration. Emile Coué pointed out that “When the imagination and the will are in conflict, the imagination always wins.” If you will yourself to remember something without using your imagination, you will have zero retention and recall. Your imagination is the key to unlocking your unlimited memory power. Some people say, “This is not the way I naturally think.” This is not the way that I naturally think either; this is how I have taught myself to think, because it works. The more skilled you become in using your imagination, the more you can know, comprehend, and create. In this way, you become the director of your own mind.

‘But, such is the passivity of Hindu society that both caste and Untouchability still thrive. Nay, several Hindu leaders…misguided by the interested propaganda by certain Britishers, still plead that there is some mysterious virtue in caste because Hindu culture has remained today. Else, they argue, caste would not have survived the shocks of centuries… It is most tragic to find that, in spite of all that Gandhiji and other reformers have done, Untouchability still persists to no small extent. It is most rampant in villages. Even in a city like Bombay, a person known to be a sweeper, let alone a scavenger, however clean dressed he may be, is not allowed to enter a caste Hindu restaurant, nay, even an Irani’s restaurant for tea.’

The most important of these skills, and power’s crucial foundation, is the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a situation is the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feelings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control.

It is surprising that such a tradeoff of energy between different life processes like 'reproduction', 'repair and maintenance of the body', growth, neurogenesis and immunity indeed exists in our present biological theories! The biologists have noted that in rats, there exists an inverse relation between the amount of fecundity and lifespan, and increasing one result in a decrease of the other!

Morals are needed for stability and control of society. In the absence of any one of these, the society can go to the abyss. That is why a society needs religion. 2. He must be a rationalist to maintain religion. Science is rationalist. 3. Mere code of ethics does not mean religion. The ethics of religion should recognise the basic principles of liberty, equality and fraternity. 4. No religion should insist on accepting poverty as sacred or glorify poverty. Initially there were four varnas. The basis of varnas was religion and later these four varnas became castes. The four varnas were divisions of the same part. It was not division of work but that of labour. Casteism has originated from this religion. It has confined a person to his caste. Due to this, the qualities of human beings have become secondary. Where there is caste, there is no purity. Religion is a personal matter of the liberation of the human soul. Religion maintains mutual harmony and morality of human beings on the basis of morals.

This is our ideology. We have taken it from the Gita. Satyagraha is the main proposition of the Gita. The Gita is acceptable to both the touchable and the untouchable. The basis of our movement is bringing people together.

The basis of Hinduism is the varna system, which makes us untouchables. I do not accept the caste system and untouchability of the Hindu system. I do not accept any authority other than the Bhagavad Gita. Although I do not accept the authority of the Vedas, I am a Sanatana Hindu.

because if one fanatical person takes the path of non-violence to prove himself, then his obsession cannot be called satyagraha or if a person fighting for truth commits violence for its accomplishment, then his fight for truth cannot be called fanaticism. If it was so, then what should the path of violence that Shri Krishna forced Arjuna in the Gita to accept for the accomplishment of truth be called?

As a matter of fact, untouchability is such a terrible evil that there is no harm even if some people have to sacrifice their lives for its prevention. Just living is not everything. There are many ways to live. Even crows eat dirt and live for many years, but no one will say that there is value in their life.

A person’s fight for truth or non-truth does not depend on the means employed for its success, rather it entirely depends on its moral nature. Violence and non-violence are only the means to the success of that fight. Although the form of the action changes with deed or at the request of the doer, the request for some means does not change the moral nature of the request; because if one fanatical person takes the path of non-violence to prove himself, then his obsession cannot be called satyagraha or if a person fighting for truth commits violence for its accomplishment, then his fight for truth cannot be called fanaticism. If it was so, then what should the path of violence that Shri Krishna forced Arjuna in the Gita to accept for the accomplishment of truth be called?

Why cry or panic about death? Sacrificing a mortal body in order to achieve something more eternal than this, for example, for the sake of the country, for the truth, for the goal, for fame—many great men have sacrificed their lives in the line of duty in many incidents. In the Mahabharata, Veer Mata Vidula preached to her son that it is better to show a spark of bravery for a few moments and die than to rot or live a hundred wasted lives. A time has come for every mother to give such advice to her son. I believe that it is in the interest of the nation to give rest to every mother for a specified period of time during the pre-delivery and post-delivery period. The principle of language-wise province composition is so vast that it is difficult to implement it practically.

The highest good of man is consciously to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in which the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it is virtue alone which enables him to do this; as Providence rules the universe, so virtue in the soul must rule man.
